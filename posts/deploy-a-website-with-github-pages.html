<h1>How to Deploy a Website with GitHub Pages</h1>
<p>GitHub is a great software development platform. Here, you will learn how to deploy a website with
	GitHub Pages, which is an easy way to deploy a website from a GitHub repository.</p>
<h2>1. Sign Up for GitHub</h2>
<p>If you already have a GitHub account, <a href="#step-2">skip to Step 2.</a><br>
	<a href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to sign up for
		GitHub.</a>
	<p> You will see a sign-up form. Enter a
		username, email address and password. You can choose below if you want to receive product updates,
		announcements and offers through email.
		To verify your account, scroll down and click "Verify" and solve the puzzle.</p><img

	<span id="step-2"></span>
	<p>Once you have filled everything in, click "Create account". Next, you will have to fill in some more
		details to personalize GitHub. Then, you will be asked to verify your email address. Go to your inbox and
		open the verification email.
		Click the verification link to verify your email address. Once all that is done, your account will be ready.
	</p>
	<h2>2. Creating a Repository</h2>
	<p>If you don't know anything about Git or GitHub, we recommend learning the basics first, especially if you
		want to use GitHub for more than just creating one website.<br>
		To create a new repository, click "New" on the left.</p><img src="/images/repo.png"
		alt="Creating a new repository on GitHub">
	<p>Now, make sure
		you name the repository <strong>exactly</strong> <span
			class="inline-code"><var>YourUsername</var>.github.io</span> and replace "YourUsername" with your actual
		username.
		Naming it right is important. If you name it wrong, your website won't be published!</p>

	<p>After you're done, click "Create repository".</p>
	<h2>3. Upload/Create Files</h2>
	<p>Now once your repository is created, it's time to add files. if you already have the files for your website
		on your computer, click "Upload files". There, you can drag and drop files or open the file chooser.
		If you haven't created any files for the website, you can just click "Create new file". Name it
		"index.html",
		because that's the name web browsers expect for the main page of your website. Type your
		code, click "Commit changes" and your website will be published soon. To view your website,
		go to <span class="inline-code"><var>YourUsername</var>.github.io</span> (replacing "YourUsername" with your
		actual username) and use the shortcut
		<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> until
		your website appears. This shortcut will clear the browser cache and reload the site to see it quickly
		(cache files are stored by the browser to speed up the loading time of a website). If that shortcut doesn't
		seem to do anything, try <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>.
		Your website is now ready!</p>
